    <h1>Computer Graphics Project – 3D Letter Modeling & Texturing</h1>
    <h3>(C++ | OpenGL | Computer Graphics)</h3>

    <p>
        This project involved designing and rendering a 3D model of the letter <strong>“S”</strong> using C++ and OpenGL. 
        The model was constructed by tessellating a 2D shape in the XY-plane and extruding it along the Z-axis to 
        form a volumetric 3D object. The project focused heavily on geometry generation, vertex construction, 
        texturing, and understanding computer graphics pipeline fundamentals.
    </p>

    <h2>🔷 Key Contributions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>3D Modeling:</strong> Created a precise 2D outline of the letter “S” using tessellation, then extruded 
            the polygon to generate a complete 3D representation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Geometry Construction:</strong> Computed and connected vertices to form quads for the side surfaces, ensuring 
            clean edges, smooth curvature, and a visually accurate 3D structure.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Texture Mapping:</strong> Applied three different textures—one for the top, one for the bottom, and a 
            continuous “rubber-band” style texture for the sides to simulate realistic 2D-to-3D unfolding.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>OpenGL Techniques:</strong> Implemented texture coordinate mapping, vertex manipulation, normal generation, 
            and real-time rendering using the modern OpenGL pipeline.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔷 Technical Skills & Concepts Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Polygon tessellation & geometric modeling</li>
        <li>Manual vertex + quad generation</li>
        <li>Texture coordinate calculations (UV mapping)</li>
        <li>Extrusion along an axis to create 3D forms</li>
        <li>Using OpenGL for rendering textured 3D objects</li>
        <li>Understanding the graphics pipeline: vertices → shaders → rasterization</li>
        <li>Intro to real-time rendering and performance considerations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔷 Final Output</h2>
    <p>
        The result was a fully textured, smooth, and accurately modeled 3D letter “S” rendered in real time. 
        The project strengthened my understanding of low-level graphics programming and gave me practical 
        experience with the fundamentals that underlie modern 3D engines.
